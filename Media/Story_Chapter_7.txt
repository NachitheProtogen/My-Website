Nachi was on the lookout for Circuit but couldn't find her anywhere.
"Nachi!" he heard from behind him. It was Kudo.
"How was your first run? Is everything alright? You look absolutely terrified."
"It was odd, I saw another Protogen but... they didn't seem really talkative or alive even."
"What the heck?!" Kudo was shocked before Nachi explained everything to him while they were on their way to look for Circuit.
They went to the streets to find any trace of her but threir without luck.
"Maybe check the entrences" Kudo suggested.
So they went to the entrance where Nachi went to Fortuna first. They saw some splaching of water near it.
