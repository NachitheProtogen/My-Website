Meet Nachi a gray and green Protogen with green holographic wings, a Batch symbol >_ on his visor, and green Hair tips on his Head and Tail.
Raised by humans on Earth, he spent 15 Years with his "Family" being treated and educated well. But he always had a desire to explore the world.
It is in his Programming to learn but considering his unknown Alien Origin, letting him out would be a massive risk that his Family didn't want to take.
So Celebrating his 15 Years with his Family(unknown to him that it is his 18th Birthday) he decided to go out on his own to find out about the world.
His plan to break out of the Place he called home was set. So he went out into a Rainy Night, something he could only ever observe from windows and media.
His fascination for it was obvious, not even a drop scared him and this moment manifested what his journey would hold for him.
