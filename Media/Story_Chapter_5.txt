After a while, Nachi woke up and he was greeted by a lot of unknown faces and Kudo. 
"What happened?" Nachi struggled to get up.
"NACHI!" Kudo ran up to him and hugged him. Nachi still overwhelmed with the situation looked visibly confused.
"You did it! You saved us!" Nachi realized that all the people in the room wanted to show their gratitude. They all wore different banners.
"Give us some time alone!" Kudo reiterated. Most people went out besides Kudo and 4 other people who all were wearing different banners.
