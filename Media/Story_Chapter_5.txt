After a while, Nachi woke up and he was greeted by a lot of unknown faces and Kudo. 
"What happened?" Nachi struggled to get up.
"NACHI!" Kudo ran up to him and hugged him. Nachi still overwhelmed with the situation looked visibly confused.
"You did it! You saved us!" Nachi realized that all the people in the room wanted to show their gratitude. They all wore different banners.
"Give us some time alone!" Kudo reiterated. Most people went out besides Kudo and 4 other people who all were wearing different banners.
"And who are you all?" Nachi asked in confusion.
"Those are the Operators of all the different banners in Fortuna," Kudo said.
Fortuna has a system where people who exceed in their banner become Operators of that banner leading those who are not as experienced. They get assigned by the elders who have been retired Operators from before.
The person with the Red banner introduced themselves first. - "You can call me Blaze we all use nicknames here and I saw what you got as a runner maybe you can run with us one day when you are 18!"
He wore a Red Banner with a belt of the same equipment Nachi already used. He was very tall Probably about 1,90 meters and he Had short black hair with red hair. All Operators had their Hairtips colored the same color as their banner beside the one for the Technicians.
"I am Circuit you are a Protogen like me!" Circuit was the Operator of the Tecnitions and was a Protogen with yellow armor and White fur who was wearing the Green Banner, their belt held a bunch of circuit boards, a walkie talkie and a Phone it looks like.
"I thought you never saw other Protogens Kudo?" - said Nachi
"This is the first time she showed herself, you are that special enough Nachi." Nachi Blushes and is flattered that another Protogen would reveal themself because of him.
"Anyways I am Mend I Operate our Cookes and Medics" She was wearing the Blue Banner with a Belt that had A bunch of Medic Bags and a Defabrelator on it. She Had white hair with Blue tips, she was Just about as tall as Nachi maybe a little smaller about 1,75 Meters.
"I am also the person that took care of you in the time that you were injured," she said.
"And I am alloy I Operate the Construction workers of Fortuna." He looked very strong and wore very warm clothing under his banner and got the same equipment on his belt that Nachi had when he wore it.
Blaze took a moment to speak up "Anyways we are very thankful for your quick thinking and what you have done for us. We will be there for you and Fortuna will be to anytime in the future."
Then everyone besides Circuit and Kudo left.
