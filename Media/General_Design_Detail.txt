Nachi has a dark sense of humor but starts any new interaction formally and respectfully.

Nachi sometimes gets self-centered due to his origin which can be mistakes as arrogance.

He could access computer systems by simply touching them allowing him to use them even tho he only has 3 fingers/claws.

His wings don't let him fly but act as a signal amplifier and a holographic Display.
(He also adores his tail :3)
