"Nachi, Nachi wake up!"
Nachi was laying in the carpet he called his bed by now.
"Come on sleepy head Blaze needs you!"
Nachi made no effort to get up so Kudo decided to pull Nachi out by his tail.
"What the hell Kudo!" Nachi screamed after he fell on the floor.
"You wanted to do this so you better not blame me for making you show up to it."
"Mind reminding me what I signed up for? It's a little early after all," he said while he went to get up and straightened his hair.
"About going up to the City since you are 18 already? The entire runner part?" Kudo mentioned while he sat down on Nachi's like a hammock hanging Karpet.
"Oh yeah, I forgot about that part... you wanna race me there?" Nachi got pretty good with Navigating the upper levels of Fortuna so he thought he could easily win this.
"You bet sleepyhead!" Kudo said as he Rushed out to run to the Scaffolding he used to reach the Roofs. Nachi soon followed rushing across the roofs of the city.
After rushing over rooftops and Scaffolding Nachi arrives first without getting tired.
"You are insane Nachi" Kudo was huffing and exhausted an issue Nachi didn't have.
They both arrived at the sewer tunnel where Blaze was already waiting for Nachi.
"Earlier than expected" Blaze mentioned.
"Someone reminded me" Nachi winked at Kudo who was still resting from the race.
Blaze gave Nachi the same Red Banner belt that he used when he ran through the sewers the first time.
"Are you excited?" Blaze asked Nachi while he put on the belt.
"Very, been waiting to get back there for a bit."
