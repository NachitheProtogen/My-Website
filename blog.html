          <h5>Update on the last few weeks | Feb 19, 2024</h5>
          <p class="text">Hey there,</p>
          <br />

          <p>
            I decided that I would be writing a blog again since I don't have
            that many ideas for my story and life is going kinda crazy, so I
            will just use this as an outlet. So about the story first, since
            it's kinda my main objective rn. I had one moment a few days ago
            where I got a bunch of plot ideas and even commissioned a piece for
            the story. Then I was writing it and I only got the motivation for
            it because I was in college. I have a bunch of problems with my
            college, especially what we learn and how we learn it. We do a lot
            of general knowledge have German, Math and English subjects, while
            all our IT subjects are taught by the same person. The issue with
            that is that my general interest lies in IT and It is not educated
            enough for me. So I just start to code in ltr any other class or
            write started or something like that. I learn most of my coding
            knowledge at home and through passion, my college only gave me
            motivation to start, and I am not sure how much this is worth.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My mom also suddenly broke her right arm, which just screws with
            taking care of my hobbies. Because I would have to take care of her
            and most of the chores she did, aka cooking, etc... It's exhausting
            and tiring, and it makes me feel less motivated to go after these
            hobbies, and it kinda upsets me... like a lot. One of the few good
            things that happened was that I reconnected with a bunch of old
            friends and a few new ones that stick with me, which I really
            appreciate :3
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            One factor that also fucks with me is my habit of impulsive
            purchases. I have a history of buying things impulsively discarding
            what I have on my account and since this is my birthday month, it
            happened a lot more than usual. I sometimes buy games without
            thinking about it, items to not get into an awkward situation in a
            market or just buy them because I just can. This is still giving me
            trouble, especially when thinking about how much money I spend on
            games, like, where I stick with one game and just buy stuff for the
            sake of buying it, since I have played the game for ages anyway.
            It's horrible for me to think about, but I guess I can be happy that
            nothing bad has happened yet.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is just a small update for me. I felt like writing about this
            again because of a talk I had with one of my friends about my issues
            and I think I might as well use my website as a place for it. I will
            try my best to go positively through these times and, as a shoutout
            to one of my friends, I want to offer it to Microwave :3 Hello!
            Anyway, I will see you reader whenever
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Cheers <3</p>

        <div class="card"> <!--Alright 1.0.0 is finaly done-->
          <h2 class="title">1.0.0 Is finaly done</h2>
          <h5>1.0.0 is done so I will give out an update for you | Feb 1, 2024</h5>
          <p>
            Alright, 1.0.0 Is done and with that, the website is now hosted
            under https://shadow-nachi.de. With that, this is now the project I
            invested in the most. Not really money but general effort and
            passion. I enjoy working with HTML more than I thought and it is
            generally fun to see people enjoying the website and sharing
            feedback with me. Seeing people enjoy the lore of my Character and
            the Art that was made of him is some of the most heartwarming
            feelings I have gotten with him. With that, most of my focus is now
            set on continuing Nachi's story since I am pretty much out of Ideas
            on what to add here so far. There is not gonna be much traffic on
            this site since it is nothing too interesting if you don't already
            know me but if anyone does stumble upon this website consider
            telling me about it on any of my socials :D.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p class="text">
            Otherwise, my life is going pretty well right now. I have gotten my
            midways with a 2.6 which in Germany is pretty decent. My birthday is
            in 2 days on the 3rd which is going to be exciting and I got paid
            which means I can continue my Bad Financial decisions and buy a
            worrying amount of art X3. With IT my College is not teaching me
            many new things. Usually, I work on this website in class since I am
            doing pretty decent anyway so that is all that is for lol.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p class="text">
            Not sure if I am good at blogging but that is it for me for now. And
            since this is the second blog I will incorporate an Idea I had which
            is to call out one of my Friends whenever I write a Blog. So I hope
            you read this Snowy, even if you are way more than a friend this is
            a callout for you!
          </p>
          <p class="text">So I will see y'all whenever</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p class="text">Take care.</p>

        <div class="card"> <!--First Blog-->
          <h2>The first Blog!!!</h2>
          <h5>Blog for testing purposes | Jan 27, 2024</h5>
          <p>
            This one is mostly for testing purposes but I do plan on posting
            here at least once a month or at least trying to. Anyways I will
            make a little introduction here since I might as well right? My name
            on the Internet is Nachi or Shadow_Nachi or Nachi the Protogen
            really depends on where you find me. I do not plan on using my real
            name on this website or anything related with my Protogen identity
            on here. I already know that my classmates will find it since I am
            not really hiding it or anything so I will say hi to you guys :D but
            that is really it. Otherwise I am really open to hear about
            improvements I could make to this considering I am really new to
            Blogging + the website thingy ++ Story telling I would really
            appreciate some feedback
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So first things first I wanna improve on the artcorner since I have
            not put much work into it yet. I am also in discord about if I
            should put art of my older Sonas into it since... it's not great.
            Otherwise most of my art is made by one person (Hi Dex :3) So there
            isn't much diffrent stuff to share. But I do got some pices so I
            might as well share the newer ones first and see where we go from
            here. Another thing is that my Birthday is very soon on the 3rd of
            February so I am excited for that. Mostly since it's my 18th
            birthday so a lot of doors open for me. I will gain more freedom for
            myself and with that I am excited for what that brings me. Otherwise
            Programming is my focus. I know I should continue on leraning C# but
            I am just stuck with web development and Node for now. But that is
            enought from me for this blockpost. I wanna push this version out
            before going to bed and it's 20:38 right now. So for the 2 people
            that read this if you have any ideas on improving this website just
            hit me up on discord I would highly appreciate it. You can find it
            in the fooder of the website. Soo I will see y'all when I got
            another big update :3
