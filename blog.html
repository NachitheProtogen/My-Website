        <h2>The first Blog!!!</h2>
        <h5>Blog for testing purposes, Jan 27, 2024</h5>
        <p>This one is mostly for testing purposes but I do plan on posting here at least once a month or at least trying to. Anyways I will make a little introduction here since I might as well right?
            My name on the Internet is Nachi or Shadow_Nachi or Nachi the Protogen really depends on where you find me. I do not plan on using my real name on this website or anything related 
            with my Protogen identity on here. I already know that my classmates will find it since I am not really hiding it or anything so I will say hi to you guys :D but that is really it.
            Otherwise I am really open to hear about improvements I could make to this considering I am really new to Blogging + the website thingy ++ Story telling I would really appreciate some feedback            
        </p> <br>
        <p>So first things first I wanna improve on the artcorner since I have not put much work into it yet. I am also in discord about if I should put art of my older Sonas into it since... it's not great.
            Otherwise most of my art is made by one person (Hi Dex :3) So there isn't much diffrent stuff to share. But I do got some pices so I might as well share the newer ones first and see where 
            we go from here. Another thing is that my Birthday is very soon on the 3rd of February so I am excited for that. Mostly since it's my 18th birthday so a lot of doors open for me. 
            I will gain more freedom for myself and with that I am excited for what that brings me. Otherwise Programming is my focus. I know I should continue on leraning C# but I am just stuck with web 
            development and Node for now. But that is enought from me for this blockpost. I wanna push this version out before going to bed and it's 20:38 right now. So for the 2 people that read 
            this if you have any ideas on improving this website just hit me up on discord I would highly appreciate it. You can find it in the fooder of the website. Soo I will see y'all when I got another big update :3
