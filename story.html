        <br> <br>
        <p class="text">Nachi is my Protogen and I wrote a story for him!</p>
        <p class="text">If you wanna read it then I will host it here for all of you!</p> <br>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h1 class="title">Origin</h1>
        <p class="text">Meet Nachi, a gray and green Protogen with green holographic wings, a Batch symbol >_ on his
          visor, and green hair tips on his head and tail.</p>
        <p class="text">Raised by humans on Earth, he spent 15 years with his "Family," being treated and educated well.
          But he always had a desire to explore the world.</p>
        <p class="text">It is in his programming to learn, but considering his unknown alien origin, letting him out
          would be a massive risk that his family didn't want to take.</p>
        <p class="text">So celebrating his 15 years with his family (unknown to him that it is his 18th birthday), he
          decided to go out on his own to find out about the world.</p>
        <p class="text">His plan to break out of the place he called home was set. So he went out into a rainy night,
          something he could only ever observe from windows and media.</p>
        <p class="text">His fascination for it was obvious; not even a drop scared him, and this moment manifested what
          his journey would hold for him.</p>
        <br> <br>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h1 class="title" id="chapter1target">Chapter 1 | Hello New World</h1> <br>
        <p class="text">Raindrops slide down his wings as he observes his surroundings. What he was looking at was a big
            city filled with life and vibrant lights.</p>
        <p class="text">No one noticed Nachi's unique design since everyone was too busy with their own life to notice
            him. </p>
        <p class="text">So he ventured on seemingly directionless into the City center from there on he had a bunch of
            directions he could go to.</p>
        <p class="text">On his way to the City center, he noticed an event that was going on. On the other side of the
            street, multiple people were running into an alleyway.</p>
        <p class="text">Odded out by this unusual scenery his curiosity got the better of him so he started to follow
            them. The alleyway was very dark, so dark in fact that Nachi was the only thing illuminating it.</p>
        <p class="text">At the end of the alleyway, he found some sort of entrance into the canals of the city. After
            arguing with himself Nachi went out and explored the canals.</p>
        <p class="text">After about a kilometer of walking, he found a big room under the city filled with people living
            in shelters and very small houses.</p>
        <p class="text">He stumbled over a hidden underground community maybe he could find answers about his origins
            here? Those were the first thoughts entering Nachi's mind before he had to introduce himself.</p>
        <p class="text">The people here were not as blind to his unusual look then the others and while he was trying to
            find his way around he noticed a lot of looks and whispers coming his way.</p>
        <p class="text">"Hey you" He heard from the distance. </p>
        <p class="text">"You don't look like you're from around here". The person in question is a human with short
            brown hair and an armless top, their expression was a curious one.</p>
        <p class="text">"How do you know?" Nachi asked while already knowing the answer. </p>
        <p class="text">"Look at yourself, you're not human. You are a Protogen!"</p>
        <p class="text">"A what now?" He asked in confusion.</p>
        <p class="text">"A Protogen! You are one of those fluffy people with the visors. But I never quite saw one like
            you."</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi was overwhelmed at the moment. He is a Protogen known to be fluffy People with visors like
            his.</p>
        <p class="text">"Well, where are my manners my name is Kudo and what are you called?" He asked in a very polite
            tone.</p>
        <p class="text">"Nachi... my Name is Nachi. I lived with my Family here for 15 Years." Nachi's expression was an
            overwhelmed one and it was pretty noticeable.</p>
        <p class="text">"Is everything alright with you Nachi?" He laid his hand on Nachi's shoulder, a gesture he was
            not familiar with.</p>
        <p class="text">"I'm fine, I have never really been 'Outside' before."</p>
        <p class="text">"That's okay, we will get you up to speed soon enough" He laid his arm around Nachi's shoulder
            and walked with him through this underground community.</p>
        <br> <br>
    </div>
          <div class="card">
        <h1 class="title" id="chapter2target">Chapter 2 | Integration</h1> <br>
        <p class="text">Nachi follows Kudo closely, he is in wonder about everything he sees from shelters to living
            spaces on scaffolding.</p>
        <p class="text">"What is this place called?" - Nachi asked out of his curiosity.</p>
        <p class="text">"We call it 'Fortuna' or at least we do; no one else knows this place besides the people that
            live here." Kudo seems passionate about this place.</p>
        <p class="text">Maybe he grew up here; those were Nachi's first thoughts. After a short walk, they arrived at a big
            shelter, covered with rugs and planes, genuinely way bigger than most of the living spaces here.</p>
        <p class="text">"We found one" - Kudo screamed into the big building. Do they already expect a Protogen? "Come
            in" - Came from the inside.</p>
        <p class="text">Kudo pushed one of the rugs out of the way, and they both went inside. The atmosphere was like
            nothing else. Everything was lit up by cozy lights, and the entire floor was filled with carpets.</p>
        <p class="text">Considering how big this shelter is, there were only 2 people here. One seemed like an elder, and
            the other looked like one of those people that he followed in here.</p>
        <p class="text">"Look at you; I never thought I would see another one of your race ever again" - the elderly
            woman said; her hair was tied together, and she was wearing some sort of poncho.</p>
        <p class="text">"It's... uh a pleasure to be here?" Nachi wasn't in many social situations; he barely knew what
            to say without it coming across the wrong way. </p>
        <p class="text">"You seem... confused; how did you get here in the first place?"</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi took a seat on the long carpet to explain what happened, and Kudo sat down next to him.</p>
        <p class="text">After a long session of explaining where Nachi was raised and how he got to Fortuna, there
            were still a few unanswered questions. Like where he came from or why he looks way older than 15.</p>
        <p class="text">"Well, you had a long way getting here; wouldn't you like to take a rest?" </p>
        <p class="text">"I would appreciate that... yeah" Nachi had been going through a lot that day, and the fact they
            offered him a place to rest was very overwhelming for him at first.</p>
        <p class="text">When Kudo shows Nachi his place to sleep, he is surprised to find it is an elevated carpet used
            as a hammock.</p>
        <p class="text">"If you need anything, then just tell me! I am one room next to you!" Kudo said. </p>
        <p class="text">Nachi was still extremely wet from the rain, so his priority was to dry himself and collect what
            he learned. He figured out what his species was called and that he was in a place called Fortuna.</p>
        <p class="text">After drying himself up by rolling on the rugs on the floor, he laid himself in his makeshift
            bed. He thought of what he could do tomorrow or if he would figure out where he came from.</p>
        <p class="text">His mind was running the entire night; he also thought about his family. "Do they miss me?"
            "Are they worried?" All of these thoughts held up until the next morning when Kudo woke him up by pulling his tail.
        </p>
        <p class="text">"What the hell was that for?!" Said Nachi with a raised voice</p>
        <p class="text">"Hey, you act as if everyone has a tail here," Kudo said shrugging his silly action off not
            knowing how it affected Nachi</p>
        <p class="text">"Jerk"</p>
        <p class="text">"Nerd, now wake up we got work to do!" Kudo said with enthusiasm.</p>
        <p class="text">"What kind of work?" Nachi said in a 'slightly' annoyed tone as he jumped out of his carpet.</p>
        <p class="text">"Well, since you can't go catch supplies with the others because of your age, you will just help
            us build some homes. Now what do you say?" Kudo started to straighten Nachi's hair while waiting for an
            answer.</p>
        <p class="text">"I could most likely help with that." Not like Nachi had much of a choice if he wanted to
            integrate himself into the community.</p>
        <br> <br>
    </div>
    
      <div class="card">
        <h1 class="title" id="chapter3target"> Chapter 3 | Urgency</h1>
        <p class="text">Kudo brings Nachi to a shack filled with belts, helmets, and tools mostly for maintenance.</p>
        <p class="text">"Here Nachi, you can take some of this gear."</p>
        <p class="text">He offered him a belt that goes around the chest filled with a drill, a bag with screws, and a
          piece of cloth attached to the back of it with a yellow banner.</p>
        <p class="text">"What is the banner for?" Nachi asked out of curiosity.</p>
        <p class="text">"Oh, it's for the people that do maintenance. We have one color for everything red for our
          supply runners, green for people that are good with tech, blue for our cooks, and so on."</p>
        <p class="text">"Hmm, interesting." Nachi puts on his belt along with a watch and an earpiece to keep track of
          time and to communicate with the team he will be assigned with.</p>
        <p class="text">Kudo stared at Nachi for a while. "Are you okay?" - Nachi asked out of his awkwardness.</p>
        <p class="text">"Nachi, you look really cool, I have to say." Nachi, unaccustomed to receiving
          compliments, shared a subtle blush as he instinctively placed his hand behind his head in a shy gesture.</p>
        <p class="text">"T- thanks, I guess." A bell started ringing outside of the shack.</p>
        <p class="text">"Seems like this is our time to move now, come on." Apparently, this was an alarm to signalize
          that a shift started. Kudo started running across the streets until he came across some scaffolding.</p>
        <p class="text">"Okay, let me show you a little trick to move around here." Kudo jumped on the metal bars from the
          scaffolding and started climbing to the top.</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi instinctively started to do the same, being almost at the same pace as Kudo due to his
          digitigrade legs. As they both reached the top, they took in the view of Fortuna from the top.</p>
        <p class="text">It is pretty massive, all things considered. A lot of lights and shelters are visible from here.
          Also, a bunch of shacks are built out of various materials like rugs and planes, some even out of brick.</p>
        <p class="text">"You are pretty quick on your feet, huh?" Kudo seemed not exhausted at all and just started
          running across the scaffolding. Nachi followed him closely.</p>
        <p class="text">They ran across the roofs that were all connected to a system of scaffolding across Fortuna,
          mostly for travel.</p>
        <p class="text">Kudo stops on a balcony as Nachi runs into him. "Why did we stop?" Nachi asked, being a little
          disoriented.</p>
        <p class="text">"Something is going on." Kudo is pointing at a massive crowd of people on the streets. "Where
          does this come from?" Nachi asked while Kudo was sliding down a water pipe to go down the building.</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi hangs himself off the building and jumps down, landing with a sleek roll.</p>
        <p class="text">"Nice landing, let's check this out then," Kudo says as they both walk through the crowd. People
          make way for Nachi and start to stare at him, whispering stuff about him behind his back.</p>
        <p class="text">As they reach the source of the massive crowd, they find out it's a weather report. It is gonna
          be extremely stormy in the next few days, and flooding is expected. This would be devastating for Fortuna.</p>
        <p class="text">Kudo stares at this message in shock; this could mean destructive consequences for Fortuna since
          it is located in the sewers of the Neon City.</p>
        <p class="text">"Kudo, what's the plan now... Kudo?" Nachi puts his paw on Kudo's shoulder to comfort him.</p>
        <p class="text">"Our direction doesn't change. We go from building shelters to barricades." Kudo seems extremely
          serious. He is heading right to one of the big sewer tunnels where a lot of people with the same yellow banner
          wait for them.</p>
        <p class="text">"You heard the news?" Said one of the people that were waiting at the tunnel. They all wore the
          same belt with yellow banners, signaling they were construction workers.</p>
        <p class="text">"Yup, I assume we bring back the barricades?" It seems like this is not a new thing for Fortuna.
          "We would, but this storm will go on for days; we need more than just a few barricades."</p>
        <p class="text">"What about the metal gates?" Kudo asked out of desperation. "We don't have access to those;
          that's a city thing and if we wanna keep Fortuna a secret then we need to figure something out ourselves."</p>
        <p class="text">"There might be a way..." Nachi said with confidence.</p>
        <p class="text">"And who are you if I may ask?"</p>
        <p class="text">"That is Nachi, a Protogen from above. He is very capable, I can tell you that." Kudo stood up
          for Nachi so he could share his plan.</p>
        <p class="text">"Is there a chance we could close the gates without asking the city for permission?" Everyone
          stared at Nachi hearing this idea.</p>
        <p class="text">Maybe there is still hope for Fortuna.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h1 class="title" id="chapter4target">Chapter 4 | Breaking and Entering</h1>
        <p class="text">Nachi is gearing himself up for the upcoming run. He plans to go through the sewer system until
          he reaches a Flood Control room so he can activate the gates.</p>
        <p class="text">"You are insane Nachi; you have only been here for 2 days. Why take the risk?" Kudo was
          frustrated; the stress of Nachi's well-being and Fortuna's fate were messing with him.</p>
        <p class="text">"Who else will?" Nachi said as he put on one of the red belts that the runners use. It was
          filled with bags to carry supplies like medkits, food, and communication devices.</p>
        <p class="text">It also held ropes and hooks for repelling and a utility knife.</p>
        <p class="text">"Why are you wearing one of those? You can't be a runner without being 18."</p>
        <p class="text">"I already checked around; no other runner will try to get through the sewers with that storm
          brewing."</p>
        <p class="text">"I worry about you Nachi!" There was a moment of silence. "Let me go with you! This is my home
          after all."</p>
        <p class="text">"We don't need to risk more than we already do, not like people here will notice my
          disappearance anyway."</p>
        <p class="text">Kudo hugged Nachi. "Your plan better work then."</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi and Kudo collected themselves at the place where Nachi came to Fortuna first. Nachi
          configured his earpiece to his visor so that all communication would run to him directly.</p>
        <p class="text">Kudo would stay back to look at a map of the tunnel system. Nachi was equipped with a red runner
          belt and a watch; that is all he would need.</p>
        <p class="text">"You better not make this a goodbye Nachi," Kudo said.</p>
        <p class="text">"Don't worry, I will be back soon enough." Nachi hugged Kudo as a sign of camaraderie and when to
          go into the tunnel system.</p>
        <p class="text">The walkways were almost filled with water as Nachi went onward with Kudo's help. They went
          through overflooded tunnels until they reached a metal gate which signaled the control room being in that
          section.</p>
        <p class="text">"Is this it?" Nachi asked Kudo.</p>
        <p class="text">"Should be close; you should see an observation window as a sign that the room is there. And make
          sure you're not seen."</p>
        <p class="text">Soon enough Nachi figured out what Kudo was talking about. He saw a big window with bright
          lights in it. He saw multiple people in it and a ventilation shaft in it.</p>
        <p class="text">"There might be a way in through a vent... Kudo?" The signal broke up. Nachi could probably fix
          it with his wings but it would expose him so he was on his own for now.</p>
        <p class="text">"Alright, no coms then, now to finding a way in." Nachi went in the water to not be spotted and
          went around the room, and he saw a vent on the ceiling.</p>
        <p class="text">"I could most likely climb up there." He mumbled to himself. He observed a pipe that was leading
          to the ceiling. He jumped out of the water quickly and climbed up the pipe until he reached the ceiling.</p>
        <p class="text">Then he swung himself into the vent praying that he wasn't seen. He slowly crawled through the
          vent until he found an entry point into the control room.</p>
        <p class="text">"Alright now to the fun part." Nachi attached a hook to the opening and repelled himself down. He
          was in a locker room so it was not the vent he saw at the start which was fortunate since it was less exposed.
        </p>
        <p class="text">He took a peek outside and heard a loud bell ringing. He looked at his watch, and it was close to
          night, and all the people in the room had gone somewhere.</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi used the opportunity to look for the control panel. It was in the middle of the room, and
          making sure he wasn't seen, he hacked into it with his claws.</p>
        <p class="text">He closed down all the gates to Fortuna, put a timer on his way back, and made a run for it. He
          ran through a door to the outside and saw a human in the corner of his vision before he ran out. </p>
        <p class="text">The water level rose up so much that he had to almost jump through the water to get through the
          gates in a fast pace. Nachi ran as fast as he can until he heard a distortion in his ear.</p>
        <p class="text">"Nachi did you get it? Are you alive?" Nachi was too focused on running to answer; he almost
          reached Fortuna before a big wave hit him. </p>
        <p class="text">The water brought him to Fortuna, where he got spilled at the entrance of it before the gates
          closed.</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi currently unconscious saved Fortuna from the weather that would have most likely destroyed
          it.</p>
        <p class="text">"Wake up... please wake up." He heard from a familiar voice. Nachi weakly answered, tried to gain
          an image of what was going on.</p>
        <p class="text">"He is alive; he will wake up at some point. You can stay here and rest with him if you want."
          Then he heard the footsteps go away and a door closing.</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi was exhausted; he was in some sort of medical room. He saw Kudo sitting next to him just
          waiting. </p>
        <p class="text">Nachi smirked before resting a little more.</p>

        <h1 class="title" id="chapter5target">Chapter 5 | Warm Welcome</h1>
        <p class="text">After a while, Nachi woke up and he was greeted by a lot of unknown faces and Kudo. </p>
        <p class="text">"What happened?" Nachi struggled to get up.</p>
        <p class="text">"NACHI!" Kudo ran up to him and hugged him. Nachi still overwhelmed with the situation looked visibly confused.</p>
        <p class="text">"You did it! You saved us!" Nachi realized that all the people in the room wanted to show their gratitude. They all wore different banners.</p>
        <p class="text">"Give us some time alone!" Kudo reiterated. Most people went out besides Kudo and 4 other people who all were wearing different banners.</p>
        <p class="text">"And who are you all?" Nachi asked in confusion.</p>
        <p class="text">"Those are the Operators of all the different banners in Fortuna," Kudo said.</p>
        <p class="text">Fortuna has a system where people who exceed in their banner become Operators of that banner leading those who are not as experienced. They get assigned by the elders who have been retired Operators from before.</p>
        <p class="text">The person with the Red banner introduced themselves first. - "You can call me Blaze; we all use nicknames here, and I saw what you got as a runner maybe you can run with us one day when you are 18!"</p>
        <p class="text">He wore a Red Banner with a belt of the same equipment Nachi already used. He was very tall, probably about 1.90 meters, and he had short black hair with red hair tips. All Operators had their Hairtips colored the same color as their banner beside the one for the Technicians.</p>
        <p class="text">"I am Circuit; you are a Protogen like me!" Circuit was the Operator of the Technicians and was a Protogen with yellow armor and White fur who was wearing the Green Banner, her belt held a bunch of circuit boards, a walkie-talkie, and a Phone it looked like.</p>
        <p class="text">"I thought you never saw other Protogens Kudo?" - said Nachi</p>
        <p class="text">"This is the first time she showed herself, you are that special enough Nachi." Nachi Blushes and is flattered that another Protogen would reveal themselves because of him.</p>
        <p class="text">"Anyways, I am Mend. I Operate our Cooks and Medics." She was wearing the Blue Banner with a Belt that had a bunch of Medic Bags and a Defibrillator on it. She had white hair with Blue tips, she was just about as tall as Nachi maybe a little smaller about 1.75 Meters.</p>
        <p class="text">"I am also the person that took care of you in the time that you were injured," she said.</p>
        <p class="text">"And I am Alloy; I Operate the Construction workers of Fortuna." He looked very strong and wore very warm clothing under his banner and got the same equipment on his belt that Nachi had when he wore it.</p>
        <p class="text">Blaze took a moment to speak up "Anyways we are very thankful for your quick thinking and what you have done for us. We will be there for you, and Fortuna will be too anytime in the future."</p>
        <p class="text">Then everyone besides Circuit and Kudo left.</p>
        <p class="text">"Nachi, you are one of the only Protogens that have made it here in a long time longer than I am here. I hope that you do stay with us"</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi didn't mean to stay here as long as he did, but it was his best chance to figure out where he came from, especially with another Protogen like Circuit on his side.</p>
        <p class="text">"I think I will stick around for a little bit," Nachi said while getting up from the bed he was resting in stumbling while going down.</p>
        <p class="text">"Are you sure you wanna get up this early?" Kudo said out of worry. Nachi nodded.</p>
        <p class="text">"Nachi, can I speak with you in private? There are a few things you need to know about yourself before you go out unprepared." Circuit asked.</p>
        <p class="text">"Of course," Nachi said. They both moved out of the room onto a balcony that was watching over Fortuna. This made Nachi realize that the Medic's place was the building in Fortuna with the highest verticality.</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi leaned on the railing while Circuit sat down on it next to him.</p>
        <p class="text">"First of Nachi please take this and just connect to it and let it run." Circuit gave him a circuit board that was named 'reader'. Nachi used his claws to connect to it and it ran some sort of program.</p>
        <p class="text">"What does this do?" Nachi asked as he gave it back to Circuit. "It scans you and will give me all the Data that you held with you since your 'birth' as they call it." She took out the Phone from her belt and connected it with the circuit board.</p>
        <p class="text">"So your name is 'Nachi' you were made on EARTH?! That can't be right... what" Circuit was just as shocked as Nachi was just he was less vocal about it.</p>
        <p class="text">"What do you mean I was 'made on earth'?"</p>
        <p class="text">"That is what it looks like; I don't get a more direct location tho..." </p>
        <p class="text">"Any more things that I should know?" Nachi asked.</p>
        <p class="text">"You were made 18 Years ago, male, signal-amplifying wing display and you make connections with devices by touch." She read from her Phone.</p>
        <p class="text">"18 Years ago? I thought I had been here for 15 Years, not 18. This is... a lot Circuit" Nachi lowered his ears and was visibly overwhelmed.</p>
        <p class="text">"I think this is enough for now Nachi, I am sorry that you didn't know all this earlier." Circuit reached her paw out to comfort him and Nachi hugged her.</p>
        <p class="text">"Thank you for telling me all this." Nachi met someone of his own and got to know himself more than ever.</p>
        <p class="text">In the next few months, Nachi made a great effort to integrate himself with Fortuna and spend time with Kudo, Circuit, and all the other Operators. </p>
        <p class="text">Not knowing that Circuit might withhold something in his origin...</p>

        <h1 class="title" id="chapter6target">Chapter 6 | The Neon City</h1>
        <p class="text">"Nachi, Nachi, wake up!"</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi was lying on the carpet he called his bed by now.</p>
        <p class="text">"Come on, sleepyhead, Blaze needs you!"</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi made no effort to get up, so Kudo decided to pull Nachi out by his tail.</p>
        <p class="text">"What the hell, Kudo!" Nachi screamed after he fell on the floor.</p>
        <p class="text">"You wanted to do this, so you better not blame me for making you show up to it."</p>
        <p class="text">"Mind reminding me what I signed up for? It's a little early after all," he said while he went to get up and straightened his hair.</p>
        <p class="text">"About going up to the City since you are 18 already? The entire runner part?" Kudo mentioned while he sat down on Nachi's like a hammock-hanging carpet.</p>
        <p class="text">"Oh yeah, I forgot about that part... you wanna race me there?" Nachi got pretty good with Navigating the upper levels of Fortuna so he thought he could easily win this.</p>
        <p class="text">"You bet, sleepyhead!" Kudo said as he rushed out to run to the scaffolding he used to reach the roofs. Nachi soon followed, rushing across the roofs of the city.</p>
        <p class="text">After rushing over rooftops and scaffolding, Nachi arrives first without getting tired.</p>
        <p class="text">"You are insane, Nachi" Kudo was huffing and exhausted, an issue Nachi didn't have.</p>
        <p class="text">They both arrived at the sewer tunnel where Blaze was already waiting for Nachi.</p>
        <p class="text">"Earlier than expected," Blaze mentioned.</p>
        <p class="text">"Someone reminded me," Nachi winked at Kudo, who was still resting from the race.</p>
        <p class="text">Blaze gave Nachi the same Red Banner belt that he used when he ran through the sewers the first time.</p>
        <p class="text">"Are you excited?" Blaze asked Nachi while he put on the belt.</p>
        <p class="text">"Very, been waiting to get back there for a bit."</p>
        <p class="text">"The moment we go out there you are on your own. Just remember the way back, we will have routes across the buildings back to Fortuna. Any questions?"</p>
        <p class="text">"A few, should I be scared of being seen?"</p>
        <p class="text">"Nope, you blend right in with all the other Protogens, I just wouldn't recommend speaking to them. They're... not like you."</p>
        <p class="text">"Why... wait, what do you mean with that?" Nachi was confused, he knew there were more Protogens upside, but no one wanted to tell him why.</p>
        <p class="text">"You will see soon enough," he said as he started his walk through the sewer tunnels.</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi followed him closely. They followed a bunch of red sprays that were either in the open or hidden behind crates until they found the tunnel where Nachi first entered Fortuna.</p>
        <p class="text">"Alright, you are on your own from now on. We need any supplies you can get; there are some stores here that sometimes give us something for free. You will most likely be more convincing than I am."</p>
        <p class="text">"Good luck, Nachi!" Blaze said before he ran off. It was a rainy night just as it was when Nachi first got here. He made his way along the route Blaze gave him.</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi was not noticed among the crowd just as Blaze said. Nachi was surprised considering all the looks at him in Fortuna; it was almost like the people upside were used to Protogens.</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi went along the street until he reached a pharmacy; it was marked with the same symbol as the ones in the tunnel. He took this as a hint and went inside.</p>
        <p class="text">Inside he found a sanitized room with a bunch of shelves full of medicine. Nachi came up to the reception and asked, "Do you have any supplies? We are in need."</p>
        <p class="text">But the Receptionist answered, "Fortuna?" Nachi nodded. The Receptionist gave him a bunch of boxes full of medicine in a carry bag and whispered, "Good luck, now go."</p>
        <p class="text">After that Nachi ran outside following the street back to Fortuna. On his way, he ran into another Protogen and stumbled to the floor with them. They had white-soaked fur and white armor; they were completely expressionless. "I'm so sorry," Nachi said before he noticed that the Protogen just stood up and went on without saying a word.</p>
        <p class="text">"A-are you okay?" he reiterated before they just ran off. "Strange," he whispered to himself before deciding to follow them. He tailed the Protogen observing how they just did simple tasks like cleaning the streets from trash or washing the windows of small businesses.</p>
        <p class="text">'Why are they doing these tasks?' Nachi thought to himself before deciding to go back to Fortuna to confront Blaze. He brought the medical supplies to Mend in the Hospital.</p>
        <p class="text">"Mend," Nachi asked, "I saw one of my kind upside. I bumped into them, but they were completely expressionless. Why?" Mend was not surprised that Nachi would ask that question.</p>
        <p class="text">"Well, they're not really like you. Your consciousness is special. Maybe you should talk with Circuit about it."</p>
