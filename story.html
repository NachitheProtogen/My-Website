        <br> <br>
        <p class="text">Nachi is my Protogen and I wrote a story for him!</p>
        <p class="text">If you wanna read it then I will host it here for all of you!</p> <br>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h1 class="title">Origin</h1>
        <p class="text">Meet Nachi a gray and green Protogen with green holographic wings, a Batch symbol >_ on his
          visor, and green Hair tips on his Head and Tail.</p>
        <p class="text">Raised by humans on Earth, he spent 15 Years with his "Family" being treated and educated well.
          But he always had a desire to explore the world.</p>
        <p class="text">It is in his Programming to learn but considering his unknown Alien Origin, letting him out
          would be a massive risk that his Family didn't want to take.</p>
        <p class="text">So Celebrating his 15 Years with his Family(unknown to him that it is his 18th Birthday) he
          decided to go out on his own to find out about the world.</p>
        <p class="text">His plan to break out of the Place he called home was set. So he went out into a Rainy Night,
          something he could only ever observe from windows and media.</p>
        <p class="text">His fascination for it was obvious, not even a drop scared him and this moment manifested what
          his journey would hold for him.</p>
        <br> <br>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h1 class="title" id="chapter1target">Chapter 1 | Hello new World</h1> <br>
        <p class="text">Raindrops Slide down his wings as he observes his surroundings. What he was looking at was a big
          city filled with life and vibrant lights.</p>
        <p class="text">No one noticed Nachi's unique design since everyone was too busy with their own life to notice
          him. </p>
        <p class="text">So he ventured on seemingly directionless into the City center from there on he had a Bunch of
          directions he could go to.</p>
        <p class="text">On his way to the City center, he noticed an event that was going on. On the other side of the
          street, multiple people were running into an alleyway.</p>
        <p class="text">Odded out by this unusual scenery his curiosity got the better of him so he started to follow
          them. The alleyway was very dark, so dark in fact that Nachi was the only thing illuminating it.</p>
        <p class="text">At the end of the alleyway, he found some sort of entrance into the canals of the city. After
          arguing with himself Nachi went out and explored the canals.</p>
        <p class="text">After about a Kilometer of walking, he found a big Room under the city filled with People living
          in shelters and very small houses.</p>
        <p class="text">He stumbled over a hidden underground community maybe he could find answers about his origins
          here? Those were the first thoughts entering Nachi's mind before he had to introduce himself.</p>
        <p class="text">The people here were not as blind to his unusual look then the others and while he was trying to
          find his way around he noticed a lot of looks and whispers coming his way.</p>
        <p class="text">"Hey you" He heard from the distance. </p>
        <p class="text">"You don't look like you're from around here". The person in question is a human with short
          brown hair and an armless top, their expression was a curious one.</p>
        <p class="text">"How do you know?" Nachi asked while already knowing the answer. </p>
        <p class="text">"Look at yourself, you're not human. You are a Protogen!"</p>
        <p class="text">"A what now?" He asked in confusion.</p>
        <p class="text">"A Protogen! You are one of those fluffy people with the visors. But I never quite saw one like
          you."</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi was overwhelmed at the moment. He is a Protogen known to be fluffy People with visors like
          his.</p>
        <p class="text">"Well, where are my manners my name is Kudo and what are you called?" He asked in a very polite
          tone.</p>
        <p class="text">"Nachi... my Name is Nachi. I lived with my Family here for 15 Years." Nachi's expression was an
          overwhelmed one and it was pretty noticeable.</p>
        <p class="text">"Is everything alright with you Nachi?" He laid his hand on Nachi's shoulder, a gesture he was
          not familiar with.</p>
        <p class="text">"I'm fine, I have never really been 'Outside' before."</p>
        <p class="text">"That's okay, we will get you up to speed soon enough" He laid his arm around Nachi's shoulder
          and walked with him through this underground community.</p>
        <br> <br>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h1 class="title" id="chapter2target">Chapter 2 | Intigration</h1> <br>
        <p class="text">Nachi follows Kudo closely, he is in wonder about everything he sees from shelters to Living
          spaces on scaffolding.</p>
        <p class="text">"What is this place called" - Nachi asked out of his curiosity.</p>
        <p class="text">"We call it 'Fortuna' or at least we do, no one else knows this place besides the people that
          live here" Kudo seems passionate about this place.</p>
        <p class="text">Maybe he grew up here were Nachi's first thoughts. After a short walk, they arrived at a big
          shelter, it was covered with rugs and planes and genuinely was way bigger than most of the living spaces here.
        </p>
        <p class="text">"We found one" - Kudo screamed into the big building. Do they already expect a Protogen? "Come
          in" - Came from the inside.</p>
        <p class="text">Kudo pushed one of the rugs out of the way and they both went inside. The atmosphere was like
          nothing else. Everything was lit up by cozy lights and the entire floor was filled with carpets.</p>
        <p class="text">Considering how big this shelter is there were only 2 people here. One seemed like an elder and
          the other looked like one of those people that he followed in here.</p>
        <p class="text">"Look at you, I never thought I would see another one of your race ever again" - the elderly
          woman said, her hair was tied together and she was wearing some sort of poncho.</p>
        <p class="text">"It's... uh a pleasure to be here?" Nachi wasn't in many social situations he barely knew what
          to say without it coming across the wrong way. </p>
        <p class="text">"You seem... confused how did you get here in the first place?"</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi took a seat on the long carpet to explain what happened and Kudo sat down next to him.</p>
        <p class="text">And after a long session of explaining where Nachi was raised and how he got to Fortuna, there
          were still a few unanswered questions. Like where he came from or why he looks way older than 15.</p>
        <p class="text">"Well you had a long way getting here, wouldn't you like to take a rest?" </p>
        <p class="text">"I would appreciate that... yea" Nachi had been going through a lot that day and the fact they
          offered him a place to rest was very overwhelming for him at first.</p>
        <p class="text">When Kudo shows Nachi his place to sleep he is surprised to find it is an elevated carpet used
          as a hammock.</p>
        <p class="text">"If you need anything then just tell me! I am one room next to you!" Kudo said. </p>
        <p class="text">Nachi was still extremely wet from the rain so his priority was to dry himself and collect what
          he learned. He figured out what his species was called and that he was in a place called Fortuna.</p>
        <p class="text">After drying himself up by rolling on the rugs on the floor he laid himself in his makeshift
          bed. He thought of what he could do tomorrow or if he would figure out where he came from.</p>
        <p class="text">His mind was running the entire night, he also thought about his Family. "Do they miss me?" "Are
          they worried?" All of these thoughts held up until the next morning when Kudo woke him up by pulling his tail.
        </p>
        <p class="text">"What the hell was that for?!" Said Nachi with a raised voice</p>
        <p class="text">"Hey, you act as if everyone has a tail here," Kudo said shrugging his silly action off not
          knowing how it affected Nachi</p>
        <p class="text">"Jerk"</p>
        <p class="text">"Nerd, now wake up we got work to do!" Kudo said with enthusiasm.</p>
        <p class="text">"What kind of work?" Nachi said in a 'slightly' annoyed tone as he jumped out of his carpet.</p>
        <p class="text">"Well since you can't go catch supplies with the others because of your age you will just help
          us build some homes. Now what do you say?" Kudo started to straighten Nachi's hair while waiting for an
          answer.</p>
        <p class="text">"I could most likely help with that." Not like Nachi had much of a choice if he wanted to
          integrate himself into the community.</p>
        <br> <br>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h1 class="title" id="chapter3target"> Chapter 3 | Urgency</h1>
        <p class="text">Kudo brings Nachi to a Shack filled with belts, helmets, and tools mostly for maintenance.</p>
        <p class="text">"Here Nachi you can take some of this gear"</p>
        <p class="text">He offered him a Belt that goes around the chest filled with a Drill, a Bag with screws, and a
          piece of cloth attached to the back of it with a yellow banner.</p>
        <p class="text">"What is the banner for?" Nachi asked out of curiosity.</p>
        <p class="text">"Oh, it's for the people that do maintenance. We have one colour for everything red for our
          supply runners, green for people that are good with tec, blue for our cooks, and so on"</p>
        <p class="text">"Hmm, interesting." Nachi puts on his belt along with a watch and an earpiece to keep track of
          time and to communicate with the team he will be assigned with.</p>
        <p class="text">Kudo stared at Nachi for a while "Are you okay?" - Nachi asked out of his awkwardness.</p>
        <p class="text">"Nachi you look really fricking cool I have to say" Nachi, unaccustomed to receiving
          compliments, shared a subtle blush as he instinctively placed his hand behind his head in a shy gesture.</p>
        <p class="text">"T- thanks I guess." a bell started ringing outside of the Shack.</p>
        <p class="text">"Seems like this is our time to move now, come on" Apparently this was an alarm to signalise
          that a shift started. Kudo started running across the streets until he came across some scaffolding.</p>
        <p class="text">"Okay let me show you a little trick to move around here" Kudo jumped on the metal bars from the
          scaffolding and started climbing to the top.</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi instinctively started to do the same being almost at the same pace then Kudo due to his
          digitigrade legs. As they both reached the top they took in the view of Fortuna from the top.</p>
        <p class="text">It is pretty massive all things considered. A lot of lights and shelters are visible from here.
          Also, a bunch of shacks are built out of various materials like rugs and planes some even out of brick.</p>
        <p class="text">"You are pretty quick on your feet huh?" Kudo seemed not exhausted at all and just started
          running across the scaffolding. Nachi followed him closely.</p>
        <p class="text">They ran across the roofs that were all connected to a system of scaffolding across Fortuna
          mostly for travel.</p>
        <p class="text">Kudo stops on a balcony as Nachi runs into him. "Why did we stop?" Nachi asked being a little
          disoriented.</p>
        <p class="text">"Something is going on." Kudo is pointing at a massive crowd of people on the streets. "Where
          does this come from?" Nachi asked while Kudo was sliding down a water pipe to go down the building.</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi hangs himself off the building and jumps down landing with a sleek roll.</p>
        <p class="text">"Nice landing, let's check this out then," Kudo says as they both walk through the crowd. People
          make way for Nachi and start to stare at him whispering stuff about him behind his back.</p>
        <p class="text">As they reach the source of the massive crowd they find out it's a weather report. It is gonna
          be extremely stormy in the next few days and flooding is expected. This would be devastating for Fortuna.</p>
        <p class="text">Kudo stares at this message in shock, this could mean destructive consequences for Fortuna since
          it is located in the sewers of the Neon City.</p>
        <p class="text">"Kudo what's the plan now... Kudo?" Nachi put his paw on Kudo's shoulder to comfort him.</p>
        <p class="text">"Our direction doesn't change. We go from building Shelters to Barricades" Kudo seems extremely
          serious. He is heading right to one of the big sewer tunnels where a lot of people with the same yellow banner
          wait for them.</p>
        <p class="text">"You heard the news?" Said one of the people that were waiting at the tunnel. They all wore the
          same belt with yellow banners signaling they were construction workers.</p>
        <p class="text">"Yup, I assume we bring back the Barricades?" It seems like this is not a new thing for Fortuna.
          "We would but this Storm will go on for days we need more than just a few Barricades."</p>
        <p class="text">"What about the metal gates?" Kudo asked out of desperation. "We don't have access to those
          that's a city thing and if we wanna keep Fortuna a secret then we need to figure something out ourselves"</p>
        <p class="text">"There might be a way..." Nachi said with confidence.</p>
        <p class="text">"And who are you if I may ask?"</p>
        <p class="text">"That is Nachi, a Protogen from above. He is very capable I can tell you that." Kudo stood up
          for Nachi so he could share his plan.</p>
        <p class="text">"Is there a chance we could close the gates without asking the city for permission?" Everyone
          stared at Nachi hearing this idea.</p>
        <p class="text">Maybe there is still hope for Fortuna.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h1 class="title" id="chapter4target">Chapter 4 | Breaking and Entering</h1>
        <p class="text">Nachi is gearing himself up for the upcoming run. He plans to go through the sewer system until
          he reaches a Flood Control room so he can activate the gates.</p>
        <p class="text">"You are insane Nachi, you have only been here for 2 days why take the risk?" Kudo was
          frustrated, the stress of Nachi's well-being and Fortuna's fate were messing with him.</p>
        <p class="text">"Who else will?" Nachi said as he put on one of the red belts that the runners use. It was
          filled with bags to carry supplies like medkits, food, and Communication devices.</p>
        <p class="text">It also held ropes and hooks for repelling and a utility knife.</p>
        <p class="text">"Why are you wearing one of those? You can't be a runner without being 18."</p>
        <p class="text">"I already checked around no other runner will try to get through the sewers with that storm
          brewing."</p>
        <p class="text">"I worry about you Nachi!" There was a moment of silence. "Let me go with you! This is my home
          after all"</p>
        <p class="text">"We don't need to risk more than we already do, not like people here will notice my
          disappearance anyway."</p>
        <p class="text">Kudo hugged Nachi "Your plan better fucking work then."</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi and Kudo collected themselves at the place where Nachi came to Fortuna first. Nachi
          configured his earpiece to his visor so that all communication would run to him directly.</p>
        <p class="text">Kudo would stay back to look at a map of the tunnel system. Nachi was equipped with a red runner
          belt and a watch, that is all he would need.</p>
        <p class="text">"You better not make this a goodbye Nachi" Kudo said.</p>
        <p class="text">"Don't worry, I will be back soon enough" Nachi hugged Kudo as a sign of camaraderie and when to
          go into the tunnel system.</p>
        <p class="text">The walkways were almost filled with Water as Nachi went onward with Kudo's help. They went
          through overflooded tunnels until they reached a metal gate which signaled the control room being in that
          section.</p>
        <p class="text">"Is this it?" Nachi asked Kudo.</p>
        <p class="text">"Should be close you should see an observation window as a sign that the room is there. And make
          sure you not seen."</p>
        <p class="text">Soon enough Nachi figured out what Kudo was talking about. He saw a Big window with bright
          lights in it. He saw multiple people in it and a Ventilation shaft in it.</p>
        <p class="text">"There might be a way in through a vent... Kudo?" The signal Broke up. Nachi could probably fix
          it with his wings but it would expose him so he was on his own for now.</p>
        <p class="text">"Alright no coms then, now to finding a way in." Nachi went in the water to not be spotted and
          went around the room and he saw a vent on the ceiling.</p>
        <p class="text">"I could most likely climb up there" He mumbled to himself. He observed a pipe that was leading
          to the ceiling. He jumped out of the water quickly and climbed up the pipe until he reached the ceiling.</p>
        <p class="text">Then he swung himself into the vent praying that he wasn't seen. He slowly crawled through the
          vent until he found an entry point into the control room.</p>
        <p class="text">"Alright now to the fun part" Nachi attached a Hook to the Opening and repelled himself down. He
          was in a locker room so it was not the vent he saw at the start which was fortunate since it was less exposed.
        </p>
        <p class="text">He took a peek outside and heard a loud bell ringing. He looked on his watch and it was close to
          Night and all the people in the room had gone somewhere.</p>
        <p class="text">Nachi used the opportunity to look for the control panel. It was in the middle of the room and
          making sure he wasn't seen he hacked into it with his claws.</p>
        <p class="text">He closed down all the gates to Fortuna put a timer on his way back and made a run for it. He
          ran through a door to the outside and saw a human in the corner of his vision before he ran out. </p>
        <p class="text">The water level rose up so much at he had to almost jump though the water to get through the
          gates in a fast pace. Nachi ran as fast as he can untill he heared a distortion in his ear.</p>
        <p class="text">"Nachi did you get it? Are you alive?" Nachi was too focused on running to Awnser he almost
          reached Fortuna before a Big wave hit him. </p>
        <p class="text">The water brought him to Fortuna where he got spilled to the entrance of it before the gates
          closed.</p>
