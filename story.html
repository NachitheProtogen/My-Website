  <h1 class="title">Nachi's Story</h1>
  <br> <br>
  <p class="text">Nachi is my Protogen and I wrote a story for him!</p>
  <p class="text">If you wanna read it then I will host it here for all of you!</p> <br>
  <button class="button"><a href="Nachi.html" target="_blank">Nachi's Character</a></button> <br> <br>
  <h1 class="title">Origin</h1>
  <p class="text">Meet Nachi a gray and green Protogen with green holographic wings, a Batch symbol >_ on his visor, and green Hair tips on his Head and Tail.</p> 
  <p class="text">Raised by humans on Earth, he spent 15 Years with his "Family" being treated and educated well. But he always had a desire to explore the world.</p> 
  <p class="text">It is in his Programming to learn but considering his unknown Alien Origin, letting him out would be a massive risk that his Family didn't want to take.</p> 
  <p class="text">So Celebrating his 15 Years with his Family(unknown to him that it is his 18th Birthday) he decided to go out on his own to find out about the world.</p> 
  <p class="text">His plan to break out of the Place he called home was set. So he went out into a Rainy Night, something he could only ever observe from windows and media.</p> 
  <p class="text">His fascination for it was obvious, not even a drop scared him and this moment manifested what his journey would hold for him.</p> 
  <br> <br>
  <h1 class="title">Chapter 1 | Hello new World</h1> <br>
  <p class="text">Raindrops Slide down his wings as he observes his surroundings. What he was looking at was a big city filled with life and vibrant lights.</p>
  <p class="text">No one noticed Nachi's unique design since everyone was too busy with their own life to notice him. </p>
  <p class="text">So he ventured on seemingly directionless into the City center from there on he had a Bunch of directions he could go to.</p>
  <p class="text">On his way to the City center, he noticed an event that was going on. On the other side of the street, multiple people were running into an alleyway.</p>
  <p class="text">Odded out by this unusual scenery his curiosity got the better of him so he started to follow them. The alleyway was very dark, so dark in fact that Nachi was the only thing illuminating it.</p>
  <p class="text">At the end of the alleyway, he found some sort of entrance into the canals of the city. After arguing with himself Nachi went out and explored the canals.</p>
  <p class="text">After about a Kilometer of walking, he found a big Room under the city filled with People living in shelters and very small houses.</p>
  <p class="text">He stumbled over a hidden underground community maybe he could find answers about his origins here? Those were the first thoughts entering Nachi's mind before he had to introduce himself.</p>
  <p class="text">The people here were not as blind to his unusual look then the others and while he was trying to find his way around he noticed a lot of looks and whispers coming his way.</p>
  <p class="text">"Hey you" He heard from the distance. </p>
  <p class="text">"You don't look like you're from around here". The person in question is a human with short brown hair and an armless top, their expression was a curious one.</p>
  <p class="text">"How do you know?" Nachi asked while already knowing the answer. </p>
  <p class="text">"Look at yourself, you're not human. You are a Protogen!"</p>
  <p class="text">"A what now?" He asked in confusion.</p>
  <p class="text">"A Protogen! You are one of those fluffy people with the visors. But I never quite saw one like you."</p>
  <p class="text">Nachi was overwhelmed at the moment. He is a Protogen known to be fluffy People with visors like his.</p>
  <p class="text">"Well, where are my manners my name is Kudo and what are you called?" He asked in a very polite tone.</p>
  <p class="text">"Nachi... my Name is Nachi. I lived with my Family here for 15 Years." Nachi's expression was an overwhelmed one and it was pretty noticeable.</p>
  <p class="text">"Is everything alright with you Nachi?" He laid his hand on Nachi's shoulder, a gesture he was not familiar with.</p>
  <p class="text">"I'm fine, I have never really been 'Outside' before."</p>
  <p class="text">"That's okay, we will get you up to speed soon enough" He laid his arm around Nachi's shoulder and walked with him through this underground community.</p>
  <br> <br>
  <h1 class="title">Chapter 2 | Intigration</h1> <br>
  <p class="text">Nachi follows Kudo closely, he is in wonder about everything he sees from shelters to Living spaces on scaffolding.</p>
  <p class="text">"What is this place called" - Nachi asked out of his curiosity.</p>
  <p class="text">"We call it 'Fortuna' or at least we do, no one else knows this place besides the people that live here" Kudo seems passionate about this place.</p>
  <p class="text">Maybe he grew up here were Nachi's first thoughts. After a short walk, they arrived at a big shelter, it was covered with rugs and planes and genuinely was way bigger than most of the living spaces here.</p>
  <p class="text">"We found one" - Kudo screamed into the big building. Do they already expect a Protogen? "Come in" - Came from the inside.</p>
  <p class="text">Kudo pushed one of the rugs out of the way and they both went inside. The atmosphere was like nothing else. Everything was lit up by cozy lights and the entire floor was filled with carpets.</p>
  <p class="text">Considering how big this shelter is there were only 2 people here. One seemed like an elder and the other looked like one of those people that he followed in here.</p>
  <p class="text">"Look at you, I never thought I would see another one of your race ever again" - the elderly woman said, her hair was tied together and she was wearing some sort of poncho.</p>
  <p class="text">"It's... uh a pleasure to be here?" Nachi wasn't in many social situations he barely knew what to say without it coming across the wrong way. </p>
  <p class="text">"You seem... confused how did you get here in the first place?"</p>
  <p class="text">Nachi took a seat on the long carpet to explain what happened and Kudo sat down next to him.</p>
  <p class="text">And after a long session of explaining where Nachi was raised and how he got to Fortuna, there were still a few unanswered questions. Like where he came from or why he looks way older than 15.</p>
  <p class="text">"Well you had a long way getting here, wouldn't you like to take a rest?" </p>
  <p class="text">"I would appreciate that... yea" Nachi had been going through a lot that day and the fact they offered him a place to rest was very overwhelming for him at first.</p>
  <p class="text">When Kudo shows Nachi his place to sleep he is surprised to find it is an elevated carpet used as a hammock.</p>
  <p class="text">"If you need anything then just tell me! I am one room next to you!" Kudo said. </p>
  <p class="text">Nachi was still extremely wet from the rain so his priority was to dry himself and collect what he learned. He figured out what his species was called and that he was in a place called Fortuna.</p>
  <p class="text">After drying himself up by rolling on the rugs on the floor he laid himself in his makeshift bed. He thought of what he could do tomorrow or if he would figure out where he came from.</p>
  <p class="text">His mind was running the entire night, he also thought about his Family. "Do they miss me?" "Are they worried?" All of these thoughts held up until the next morning when Kudo woke him up by pulling his tail.</p>
  <p class="text">"What the hell was that for?!" Said Nachi with a raised voice</p>
  <p class="text">"Hey, you act as if everyone has a tail here," Kudo said shrugging his silly action off not knowing how it affected Nachi</p>
  <p class="text">"Jerk"</p>
  <p class="text">"Nerd, now wake up we got work to do!" Kudo said with enthusiasm.</p>
  <p class="text">"What kind of work?" Nachi said in a 'slightly' annoyed tone as he jumped out of his carpet.</p>
  <p class="text">"Well since you can't go catch supplies with the others because of your age you will just help us build some homes. Now what do you say?" Kudo started to straighten Nachi's hair while waiting for an answer.</p>
  <p class="text">"I could most likely help with that." Not like Nachi had much of a choice if he wanted to integrate himself into the community.</p>
